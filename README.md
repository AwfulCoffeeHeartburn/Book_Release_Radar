# To-Do List/Event Reminder
Application for keepinng track of daily tasks with one window while keeping track of upcoming events in another window.
The user can input dates for the upcoming events and on the day of the event a popup window will appear with a reminder when the application is started.
The user can prioritize events on their to-do list, making their background red.

Features to be added:
Completion of the prioritize function.
Early reminder pop-up windows, allowing the user to select how early they'd like to be reminded.
Time, allowing the user to specify times of events rather than just dates.

Bugs to be fixed:
Removing an item from the list causes all priorities to disappear and upsets the indexes used to store priorities.
Early reminder pop-up windows either cause crashes or don't run.
Can't add and remove the same item during the same session.
Reminder pop-up windows don't display every event that day, only the first event it comes in contact with.
