# Event Reminder/To-Do list application
Using Python to create a program that notifies the user the date of a pre-recorded event is approaching/has arrived. There is also a to-do list feature in progress.
It may be noted that the code and descriptions present here are also present in my fun projects repository. I've copied them here, and intend to do any expanding of them here because it occurred to me that the projects I've been working on each likely warrant their own repositories. This is me attempting to facilitate better organizational skills within myself.
